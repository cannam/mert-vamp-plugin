# MERT Vamp Plugin

This is an *experimental* [Vamp plugin](https://vamp-plugins.org)
implementation of [MERT audio
features](https://github.com/yizhilll/MERT) corresponding to the
published pre-trained
[MERT-v1-95M](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/MERT-v1-95M).

The plugin was written by Chris Cannam in the Centre for Digital
Music, Queen Mary University of London.

The plugin code is published under an MIT/X11 licence and the model
weights (included in the built artifact) are under Creative Commons
CC-BY-NC-4.0. The resulting plugin is therefore redistributable but
not for commercial use (and so not technically Open Source).
